# dotfiles

This is a repository that contains my configuration files and some utilities written by myself for UNIX (or UNIX-like) environments.

The set of these utilities are influenced by POSIXISM.
It means that the main goal is to make configs and utils which have high sustainability on many UNIX (or UNIX-like) environments.

(See for detail (Japanese text) : http://posixism.org/)
